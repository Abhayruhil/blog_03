            <p>Previous advances in A.I. inspired predictions that the law was the lucrative profession most likely to suffer job losses. It didnâ€™t happen. Is this time different?
                AI/LAW
                In my perspective it's a good article to get knowledge about the efects of AI on law feild.

            <p>One of these kind of technologies has come from some Finnish engineers who have found a way to turn sand into a giant battery.
             For me this is a very efective yet simple innovation to provide clean renewable energy.
